# CALCULATOR
This project is made by me during my internship with Grapecity.
<br><br>
## Features
- It is not a simple calculator. The structure of calculator library is very robust and scalable.
- In this library user can add their own custom operaators by just inheriting one class "Binary or Unary" and can even make their own operations like ternary and all.
- User can also change precedence of operator by just changing its value in JSON file.
- Even in UI all operations are added dynamically i.e. If we add one more custom operator, it will be shown automatically in UI.
- Apart from basic validations I also implemented validations like:
  -  It will automatically add * operator in cases like 2(3), log(2)log(1) etc.</li>
  -  Use of '.' (decimal) operator eg user can't insert numbers like 2..., 2.3.4 etc.</li>
### Simple GUI made using above library
